            <h1 class="title-index">Our Philosophy</h1>
            <p class="text-index">More and more families are choosing to Homeschool as an option to the mainstream school system. Homeschooling may imply children are sitting at home all day â€“ Not at all!
            Homeschooling simply means your children are registered to learn at home, however at School Me students often learn in groups and in the community, they frequent libraries, museums and universities. Parents provide the guidance for their education, rather than a school. School Me covers the full curriculum, enjoy community activities, homeschool group outings, outdoor exploration and travel. These are all part of a well-rounded educational experience.
            In the past homeschooling, often meant students spent less time on academic studies, however with Future Learning (a new era of homeschooling), children are empowered with a full education program covering all subject areas, in a fraction of the time of school, allowing students to develop their own personal passions & talents. Homeschooling and Distance Education are different.
            Distance education involves enrolling with a school, who provide all the work. You make sure the work is done. As the parent you are responsible for supervising the work, doing some teaching, and making sure it gets done.
            Homeschooling (future learning style) involves registering to homeschool, enrolling with the Australian homeschool department and ensuring your child receives an excellent education. Yearly reporting and re- application to your state or territory homeschool body is required and fully assisted by School Me. This gives you the peace of mind you need to know you are providing your child with every opportunity for their future.
